        <p>The toast sandwich is a luxurious dish available only to the richest
            of the U.K's (United Kingdom) elite. By stacking not one, or two, but<br> three
            pieces of bread upon each other and toasting the middle piece, one creates
            a captivating dish that is both pleasing to the eyes and palette.
