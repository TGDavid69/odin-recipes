This project is the "test" that one studying The Odin Project has to complete in order to show
that they under the basics of HTML. I will be linking images, alt & hover text, accessibility for
anyone who uses screen reader technologies and much more. It won't look all that pretty but hey,
the project is just for me to get real familiar with basic HTML syntax.
